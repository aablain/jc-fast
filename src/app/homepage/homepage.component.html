  <h3>WHY ARE WE FASTING?</h3>
  <p>As we step into 2017 and head towards the completion of our 3rd year of establishing the local church, we felt compelled as a staff to call our church family to a 40 day fast beginning Sunday, January 29th leading up to our Jesus Culture Encounter Conference that kicks off Thursday, March 9th.</p>

  <p>This will be our first time to set aside a season for focused fasting and prayer specifically to cry out to God for an immeasurable outpouring of His presence, to see the worldwide Church awakened, to prepare ourselves for the harvest of souls that is coming and witness every sphere of culture being transformed.</p>

  <p>We have compiled a list of resources below from friends and ministries we believe in to help you prepare for the fasting and prayer season we are entering into. Please take time to plan and pray into the kind of fast God would have you do and join us as we seek God together.</p>
